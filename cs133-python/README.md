### Week 1: March 31 - April 6

Things to do this week:

1. Chapters 1 & 2
2. Lab 1

#### Lab 1
The objective of this lab is to provide you with the opportunity to "play" with
the Python interpreter and to write your first Python programs.

Complete exercises 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and then 7 at the end of Chapter 2
(Variables, Expressions and Statements) in the text with a classmate. I would
encourage you to do each exercise incrementally in the immediate window in the
text, that is:

* Write your input statement. Write an output statement that simply echoes the
input. Run your program and see if it works.
* Add your assignment statement that does the calculations. Write an output
statement that echoes both the input and the result of your calculation. Run
your program and see if it works.
* After each of your program runs, make any corrections necessary and run the
program again. Continue editing and running until the code does what you want it
to do.
* Copy and paste the source code as well as the output into a text or word
processing file.

### Week 2: April 7 - April 13
Intro to Modules and Functions in Python. Turtles too.

Things to do this week:

1. Chapters 4 & 5 (Modules and Functions)
2. Lab 2

#### Lab 2
The objective of this lab is to introduce you to functions and selection or
conditional statements in Python.

Complete the following exercises from Chapters 4 (Modules) and 5 (Functions) of
your text with a classmate. Experiment with each problem until you and your
partner understand the concept presented in the problem. Document the completion
of each problem by:

* Providing your source code and output from your program
* Writing a sentence or two describing what you learned from completing the
problem.

Complete each of the following problems. Your solution to the problems in
Chapter 5 must involve writing a function definition and program that calls that
function to produce the desired results:

* Write a program that will draw a square of random size.
* Exercise 8 in Chapter 5 (Functions).
* Exercise 7 in Chapter 5.

### Week 3: April 14 - April 20
Intro to Selection Statements in Python. More Functions Too.

Things to do this week:

1. Chapters 5 & 6 (Functions and Selection)
2. Lab 3

#### Lab 3
The objective of this lab is to introduce you to functions and selection or
conditional statements in Python.

Complete the following exercises from Chapters 5 (Functions) and 6 (Selection)
of your text with a classmate:

* Chapter 5 Problem 1
* Chapter 5 Problem 2
* Chapter 5 Problem 3
* Chapter 6 Problem 7
* Chapter 6 Problem 8
* Chapter 6 Problem 10
* Chapter 6 Problem 4

Experiment with each problem until you and your partner understand the concept
presented in the problem. Document the completion of each problem by:

* Providing your source code and output from your program
* Writing a sentence or two describing what you learned from completing the
problem

### Week 4: April 21 - April 27
Repetition Statements in Python.

Things to do this week:

1. Chapters 6 & 7 (Selection and Repetition)
2. Lab 4

#### Lab 4
The objective of this lab is to introduce you to repetition statements or loops
in Python.

Complete the following exercises from Chapters 6 (Selection) and 7 (Repetition)
of your text with a classmate. Experiment with each problem until you and your
partner understand the concept presented in the problem.

Document the completion of each problem by:
 * Providing your source code and output from your program
 * Writing a sentence or two describing what you learned from completing the
 problem

Complete each of the following problems. Your solution to the problems in both
chapters must involve writing a function definition and program that calls that
function to produce the desired results:

 * Chapter 7 Problem 2 - Write a function triNumber. The function should take
 an integer,n, which represents the number in the sequence you want to calculate
 as it's parameter and should return the "nth" triangular number. Write a
 program that asks the user how many triangular numbers to print and then prints
 an attractively formatted table like the one illustrated in your text.
 * Chapter 7 Problem 3 - Write a function isPrime. The function should take an
 integer, n, which represents the number you want to check for "primeness" and
 should return true or false. Write a program that asks the usesr how many
 numbers to check for primeness and then prints an attractively formatted table
 that lists each number between 1 and the number entered by the user and whether
 or not that number is prime.
 * Chapter 7 Problem 4 - Write a function countDigits. The function should take
 an integer, n, which represents the number for which you want to count digits
 and should return an integer representing the number of digits in the number.
 Write a program that asks the user to enter a number and prints out the number
 of digits in the number. The program should then ask the user to if he/she
 wants to enter another number and should allow him/her to answer 1 to continue
 and 0 to stop. If the user enters a 1, the process should repeat.
 * Chapter 7 Problem 6 or 7
 * Chapter 7 Problem 10 or 12
