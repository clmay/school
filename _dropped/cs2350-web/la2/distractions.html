  <h2>Distraction: Food Prep</h2>
  <p>I love eating healthy and often. This can lead to serious distraction. I
    can be working away and think "I need to eat something." Then my mind goes
    to work figuring out what to eat that is healthy, how to prep it, and
    wondering if I have the stuff to make it. Then off to the kitchen I go to
    fix it. After that there is the eating. Sometimes to save time I bring the
    food back to my desk thinking I will work while I eat but really I get very
    little done while I am eating. The whole process is pretty time-consuming.
    And since it is healthy it seems like I am doing a "good" thing even though
    my work productivity is suffering.</p>
  <p>My most effective way to manage this distraction is to plan ahead. I can
    plan the best times to stop and eat. That way I don't eat too often or
    forget to eat (which can make me less effective even if I keep working.)Then
    I can prep the food ahead of time before I start work. That way when it is
    time to eat my break from work is much shorter.</p>
