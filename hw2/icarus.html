  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>This tutorial will guide you through the process of using your Icarus
    server account to host a static website. It requires the installation of a
    couple free, open-source software tools. You should have basic familiarity
    with HTML, the command line, and the file explorer on your computer, but
    this guide is otherwise suitable for beginners.</p>
  <h3 id="install-tolls">Install your tools</h3>
  <h4>Install Homebrew</h4>
  <p><a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank"
      title="Link to the Homebrew package manager homepage">Homebrew</a> is a
    package manager that brings Linux-style package installation to macOS. It
    will search a repository of software packages, fetch and install packages,
    and resolve dependencies automatically, all in a single command. It is the
    <em>de facto</em>, though unofficial, package manager for macOS.</p>
  <p>Installation is simple. Open Terminal.app (or your terminal emulator of
    choice) and run:</p>
  <pre>/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"</pre>
  <p>It's always a good idea to review the content of scripts before you run
    them, to understand what changes they perform and inspect them for dangerous
    code. The <a
      href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install"
      target="_blank" title="Homebrew install script source">Homebrew install
      script</a> is open source and you can view it directly at the address in
    the command above (<a
      href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install"
      target="_blank" title="Homebrew install script source">linked here</a>)
    for your convenience.</p>
  <h4>Install Cyberduck</h4>
  <p><a href="https://cyberduck.io/" target="_blank"
      title="Link to the Cyberduck homepage">Cyberduck</a> is another
    open-source tool for macOS that is practically standard. Cyberduck is a file
    transfer client that supports a number of protocols, most importantly FTP
    and SFTP. We will use SFTP later in the tutorial to send our files to the
    server. Using Homebrew, installing Cyberduck is a quick one-liner: </p>
  <pre>brew cask install cyberduck</pre>
  <p>This command fetches the package and all dependencies, installs the
    software, and automatically moves the app image to your /Applications
    directory. After that, you can open Cyberduck just like you would any other
    app. My personal favorite is Cmd + Space, and then just type "Cyberduck".
    Once you've typed a few characters, macOS should autopopulate the app's
    name, after which Enter will open it.</p>
  <h3 id="connect-via-sftp">Connect via SFTP</h3>
  <p>Once you have opened Cyberduck, you will need to add a connection. Click
    the "+" button in the upper-left and change the connection type from the
    default (FTP) to SFTP.</p>
  <img src="./assets/cyberduck_add_connection_opt.png"
    alt="Screenshot of Cyberduck home screen" width="640" height="591">
  <p>Then, fill in the connection dialog with the following information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Server: cs.icarus.weber.edu</li>
    <li>Port: 22 (this should be selected automatically if you chose SFTP</li>
    <li>Username: first initial + last initial + final 5 digits of your W
      number. <em>E.g.</em> 'js12345'.</li>
    <li>Password: first name + 'cs!', <em>e.g.</em> 'Johncs!' (without quotes)
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Your connection settings should be something like this:</p>
  <img src="./assets/cyberduck_enter_credentials_opt.png"
    alt="Screenshot of Cyberduck add connection dialog" width="640"
    height="591">
  <p>After that, click "Connect" and with any luck, you will be connected to the
    server and your <em>public_html</em> directory will be shown. This is the
    directory where you will upload files to make them available online. Any
    files outside of public_html will not be accessible to visitors of your
    site.</p>
  <h3 id="upload-content">Upload content to public_html directory</h3>
  <p>Now that you're connected to the server, it's time to upload some content.
    Let's start by uploading an index.html within the public_html directory.</p>
  <p>If you're anything like me, you'll enjoy the precision and brevity of the
    keyboard shortcuts offered by Cyberduck. Hit Option + Up to open the upload
    file browser. That'll open up Finder. Browse to and select the index.html
    file you wish to upload and click "Upload" in the bottom-right.</p>
  <img src="./assets/cyberduck_upload_file_opt.png"
    alt="Screenshot of Cyberduck upload dialog" width="759" height="591">
  <p>Take careful note of the location of the uploaded file. In my experience, a
    minor UX flaw in Cyberduck is that the upload process does not allow you to
    specify the exact upload location ahead-of-time, so the files are generally
    uploaded to the root level (home directory). You may need to move the
    uploaded file to the public_html directory before proceeding.</p>
  <p>You can also upload a whole folder to Cyberduck, in which case it will
    traverse the directory recursively, creating a matching tree in the
    destination and uploading files as it goes. The process for uploading a
    folder is the same, except that you select the folder you wish to upload
    instead of a single file:</p>
  <img src="./assets/cyberduck_upload_folder_opt.png"
    alt="Screenshot of Cyberduck folder upload" width="759" height="591">
  <h3 id="view-result">View the result online</h3>
  <p>Now that all of your files are uploaded, you can view the results of your
    labor.</p>
  <p>Icarus serves the files in your public_html directory at:
    <pre>
      http://icarus.cs.weber.edu/~[your-username]/
    </pre><em>e.g.</em>
    <pre>
      http://icarus.weber.edu/~js12345
    </pre>After the user subdirectory ('~js12345'), the remainder of the path
    is the same as the path to the files/folders from your public_html. That is,
    a document at 'public_html/assets/image.jpg' would be available at:
    <pre>
      http://icarus.cs.weber.edu/~js12345/assets/image.jpg
    </pre>
  </p>
  <p>So, for the example shown in the following screenshot:</p>
  <img src="./assets//cyberduck_folder_structure_opt.png"
    alt="A screenshot of a folder hierarchy in Cyberduck" width="640"
    height="591">
  <ul>
    <li> A file named 'template.html' at the root of public_html will be
      available at:
      <pre>http://icarus.cs.weber.edu/~js12345/template.html</pre>
    </li>
    <li>A file named 'another_page.html' within a subdirectory named 'folder'
      would be at:
      <pre>http://icarus.cs.weber.edu/~js12345/folder/another_page.html</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> Keep in mind that a file named 'index.html' in public_html or any of
        its descendants can also be accessed in the browser without specifying
        the filename. </p>
      <p>
        <em>E.g.</em>'public_html/folder/index.html' can be accessed directly at
        <pre>http://icarus.cs.weber.edu/~js12345/folder/</pre>
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>(Note: The instructor of this course has required that this tutorial also
    mention that the 'http://' portion of the URLs used to access the files is
    called the protocol, and that the 'icarus.cs.weber.edu' portion is called
    the hostname. However: given that these segments of the URL are constant for
    any users publishing to Icarus (since it does not provide HTTPS and since
    the hostname is beyond the user's control); and given that the
    scheme/protocol and hostname are both required in well-formed URLs, and
    indeed are part of the <em>definition</em> of their well-formedness; the
    utility of this information for the purposes of the present tutorial remains
    an open question, and one that is left as an exercise for the reader's
    imagination.)</p>
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>Now that you have the tools and knowledge necessary to upload files to the
    free hosting platform provided with your Icarus student server account, you
    should be well on your way to the complete personal website of your choice.
    Don't forget to log out of Cyberduck when you're done, and happy coding!</p>
