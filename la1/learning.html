A Study of Learning Techniques for Effective Learning (main heading 1)

<p>John Dunlosky from Kent State University and several collaborators from a
    variety of universities published an article in January of 2013. For this
    research they looked at 10 learning techniques and rated each one on how
    effective it was.</p>

<p>
    Many of the learning strategies that students commonly use were found to
    be ineffective. By developing an understanding of more effective learning
    techniques, a person can become a more effective learner.

The Top Strategies (subheading 2)
<p>
    Following are the five learning techniques that were found to have high or
    moderate utility. It is interesting to note that one of the reasons that
    some of these techniques received a moderate utility rating was because there
    was less research available on these techniques. As additional research is
    developed, these techniques may be shown to have high utility.
</p>

Practice Testing (subheading 3)
<p>
    Practice testing can consist of either self-testing or taking formal practice
    tests. Simply stopping during study to think of questions about the material
    and answering those questions to yourself is an effective tool for
    learning.

Distributed Practice (subheading 3)
<p>
    The idea behind distributed practice is to break up your practice sessions
    into small periods over a longer period of time. Other words used for this
    strategy are spaced repetition or spaced practice.

Interleaved Practice (subheading 3)
<p>
    Interleaving practice is when you mix a variety of topics in your study
    sessions. Instead of studying a single topic to completion before moving to
    the next topic you go from one topic to another and study them
    interchangeably.
</p>

Elaborative Interrogation (subheading 3)
<p>
    This technique involves turning the fact you are learning into a why question
    and then coming up with the answer. Asking why is something you were very
    good at as a small child. It is still an effective learning technique as an
    adult but this time you get to use the resources available to figure out the
    answer.

Self-Explanation (subheading 3)
<p>
    This technique involves generating your own explanation about what you are
    learning. Trying to understand new material well enough to explain it helps
    you learn it more effectively. It also helps to connect previous knowledge
    with what you are currently learning.
