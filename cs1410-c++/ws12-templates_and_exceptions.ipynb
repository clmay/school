    "A lot of what we do as programmers involve recognizing errors, anticipating them, and handling them when they occur. In fact, errors happen all the time, and we can identify three kinds of errors: \n",
    "* **Compile-time errors** which are discovered and reported by the compiler during compilation. These errors must be fixed before the program can run. Unbalanced braces or missing semicolons at the ends of statements are common examples of compile-time errors.\n",
    "* **Runtime errors** which pass the compiler's test and do not show up until the program is run. Unhandled runtime errors can crash the program. For example, entering the string `\"fifty five\"` instead of `55` for an integer variable causes an error and, unless handled, crashes the program. These errors are harder to detect than compile-time errors. We used exceptions to throw, catch, and handle these errors\n",
    "* **Logical errors** which are the worst kind of errors. These are the errors that the compiler cannot detect nor do they crash the program. Instead, your program keeps running except that it produces incorrect results. For example, mistaking May 4 (05/04/2019) for April 5 (04/05/2019) is a logical error. The only way to detect and prevent these errors is to be code carefully, be organized, and test thoroughly.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the early goals of C++ is to improve and standardize how errors are reported and handled over what C provides. In doing so, C++ distinguishes between checking for errors and handling them. Checking for errors means detecting when errors occur. Handling them means responding to them. C++ uses exceptions to achieve this separation. When an error is checked and detected inside a function, an exception is thrown. It's up to the program that called this function to catch the thrown exception and handle it. **In C++, an unhandled exception will crash the program.**.\n",
