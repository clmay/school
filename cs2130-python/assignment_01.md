# Section 1 Assignment (108 points) - Sets

To receive credit, you must either show your work on the worksheet or explain
how you got the answer.

1. (6 points) Cardinality of a set defined by a Cartesian product.

   - a. (3 pts) What is |{1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8}³|?
   - b. (3 pts) What is |{a, b, c, d, e}²|?

2. (10 points) Express each set in roster notation. Express the elements as
   strings, not n-tuples.

   - a. (5 pts) A³, where A = {a, b}
   - b. (5 pts) B², where B = {1, 2, 3}

3. (18 points) Set Properties. Use the following sets to answer the questions:

   U = {a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i}

   A = {c, d, e, i, h}

   B = {a, b, c, d, e, f, i, h}

   C = {d, {e, f}, g, h}

   - a. (3 pts) T / F {a, b, c, h, i} ⊆ U
   - b. (3 pts) T / F {} ∈ C
   - c. (3 pts) T / F {e, f} ∈ C
   - d. (3 pts) T / F {e, f, g, h} ⊆ C
   - e. (3 pts) T / F A ⊆ U
   - f. (3 pts) T / F A ⊂ B

4. (36 points) Set Operations. Use the following sets to answer the questions:

   U = {a, b, c, d, x, y, z}

   A = {b, c, x, y}

   B = {a, b, c, z}

   C = {a, b, d, y}

   - a. (6 pts) What is A ∪ C?
   - b. (6 pts) What is A ∩ B ∩ C?
   - c. (6 pts) What is U \ (A ∩ C)?
   - d. (8 pts) List all subsets of C ∩ (A ∪ B).

5. (10 pts) Draw the Venn diagram for these sets (U, A, B, C):

   U = {a, b, c, d, x, y, z}

   A = {b, c, x, y}

   B = {a, b, c, z}

   C = {a, b, d, y}

6. (20 points) Set Properties and Operations. Use the following sets to answer
   the questions:

   U = {a, b, c, d, x, y, z}

   A = {b, c, x, y}

   B = {a, b, c, z}

   C = {a, b, d, y}

   - a. (3 pt) Find C – B
   - b. (3 pt) Find B - C
   - c. (6 pt) Find A ⊕ B
   - d. (8 pts) Find |U \ (B ⊕ C)|

7. (18 points) Cartesian product of sets. Use the following sets to answer the
   questions:

   A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

   B = {x, y, z, w}

   C = {q, r, s, t}

   - a. (3 pt) T / F (5, s) ∈ A x C
   - b. (3 pt) T / F (q, 5) ∈ B x A
   - c. (3 pt) T / F (r, r) ∈ B x B
   - d. (3 pt) T / F (t, s, 4) ∈ C x B x A
   - e. (6 pt) Find |A x B|
