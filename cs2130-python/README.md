## Usage

To run a program, you will need Python 3\. Currently, all assignments only
include modules that are included with Python 3's stdlib.

```sh
python3 <filename>.py
```

Tests are included in files named `test_*.py`. You can run the tests the same
way you would run a regular program:

```sh
python3 test_<filename_to_test>.py
```
