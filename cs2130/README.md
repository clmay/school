## Usage

To run a program, you will need Python 3\. Currently, all assignments only
include modules that are included with Python 3's stdlib.

```py
python3 <filename>.py
```

Tests are included for (most) assignments in modules named `test_*.py`.

You can run the tests the same way you would run a regular program:

```py
python3 test_<filename_to_test>.py
```
